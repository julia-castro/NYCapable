This folder has the csv files that are used to seed our database. The three files used for the seeding itself are:

  1) routes.txt
  2) stations.txt
  3) route_stations.txt

The remaining files are references that make active record console verifications easier. stations_guide.txt is simply a print out of the stations and their indexes in the database, while routes_guide.txt does the same thing for routes.
